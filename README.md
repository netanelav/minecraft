# Minecraft

6th Assignment for Appleseed's Academy Coding Bootcamp (Week 6).

In the assignment, we created a 2D world version of Minecraft.

In our version, the world is pre-generated with a default matrix, the user has 3 types of tools - Axe, Pickaxe and Shovel he can use for crafting, 7 different items to craft, and a 6 place stack to play with.

The assignment is based on the following subjects:

* OOP
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
